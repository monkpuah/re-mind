# Re-Mind App version 0.0.0

A simple way to track reminders. Just write a reminder, set a date and forget it till later.

## Introduction:

This is your introduction, your goal for this iteration is to clone the repository into your local/virtual machine
and get the program to run.

Ideally, you should for the repository to your own github account and clone it from there.
All modifications should be done on your Github account and then you will to do pull request to
the core maintainer of the project, Haniiiiii.

## Usage
1. `git clone` the repo
2. Run `bundle install` to ensure that all your gems are up to date.
3. Run `ruby app.rb`

## Details:
Got the application running? Good!
If not, read the error messages and get debugging.

In another window, have a look at the code. There will be just 3 simple 'routes'
which the application will respond to. Try and use the browser or `curl` to access
the routes. By default the webserver will spawn up on either `localhost:4567` or `127.0.01:4567`

example usage of `curl`:

- `curl -v localhost:4567` to see a details output of the request
- `curl -d` to send POST data to the server
- `curl -H` to send Header information to a server

You don't need all of these now, but they will be helpful in the future

Try and access all the routes that are written in the `app.rb` file and play around and add some other routes.
Remember we will be mainly focusing on these four HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

## Application Details:
Written on Ruby using Sinatra

More to come!
